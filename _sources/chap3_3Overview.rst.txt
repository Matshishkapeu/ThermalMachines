Overview of comp/exp systems
****************************

In thermal machines, we are going to find different componants that permits compression or expansion of gases (or vapors). We mainly find:

	* Volumetric compressors (reciprocating compressors or rotative compressors) taht can be found in many industrial applications (pippelines, refrigerators, etc.).
	* Dynamic compressors found in gas turbines or turbojets.
	* Turbines.

Volumic compressors
===================
Volumic compressors increase pressure of a closed system by changing its volume. Two family of volumic compressors exist: those using a piston and those that rotate around an axis.

**Reciprocating compressor** are used in refrigerators.

**Rotative compressor** can be found in air compressors.

Dynamic compressors
===================

Dynamic compression machines contains a rotary mechanical device (rotor) rotating around an axis. They are using a mechanical energy (delivered on the axis) that is convert in energy increasing the fluid pressure (temperature).
The fluid flow is continuous in these compressors. The pressure increase is limited such that these dynamic compressors are often constituted by **multiple stages**.

Dyanmics compressors can be simple **ventilators** used for ventilation or in air conditionning systems or real compressors used to increase fluid pressure.

**Axial compressors** are mainly find in gas turbines (turbojets, power plants, etc.).

**Centrifugal compressors** are generally find in turbocharger for car engines.

Turbines
========

Turbines are mainly axial and multi-stage.
